# SARS-prediction-with-B-cell-data
Our purpose is estimating the epitope region of SARS-CoV by only analyzing the B-cell dataset.  We are addressed the problem of classifying peptides into two categories in this task: antibodies with inducing properties (positive) and antibodies without inducing properties (negative), similar to the paper we have published.
